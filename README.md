## About Our Project:

The idea generate from the quarantine habits related to covid-19, which had become one essential habit of our lifestyle and had completely halted us from meeting or interacting 
new people around us.​All the problems related to our work and life which require a need to be shared with friends or colleagues are accumulating inside us and leading to mental 
stress.
